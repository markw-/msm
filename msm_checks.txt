// Multi-Layer Synthetic Monitor Check list
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Lines begining with "//" are comment lines and are ignored, also blank lines are ignored.
// Each line consists of comma separated key/value pairs (some required and some optional), which can 
// appear in any order. The MSM software attempts to ignore formatting differences in the configuration
// file e.g. use of upper and lower case, additional spaces/tabs and leading or trailing commas. That 
// said - commas must separate KV pairs appearing on the same line and the KV pair must have the key 
// first followed by an equals sign ("=") with the value coming after that.
//
// Each key can only appear once on each line, if a key appears multiple times the last key read will
// be the value used.
// 
// The keys are:
// "type"   - One of "application", "URL" or "DB"
// "result" - Either "alive" or "timed"
// "target" - Either the application IP address and port (a.b.c.d:xxxx), a URL or the DB connection
//            string
// "text"   - Text sent to an Application check or SQL text for a DB check (must be in quotes). 
//            (Required for a DB check, optional for an application check)
// "UID"    - A user ID to be used in a check, must be in quotes. (optional) 
// "PW"     - A password to be used in a check, must be in quotes. (optional) 
// 
// It's good practice to group the checks by application group to keep track of which checks apply 
// to which applications.
// 
// Example:
// // Application A
// type=Application, result=Timed, target=192.168.2.1:5900, text="test_job_1", UID="testuser", PW="Aht24B!1"
// type=DB, result=Alive, target=192.168.21.100:5900,, UID = "testuser", PW="Aht24B!1"
// type=URL, result=timed, target=http://www.bbc.com/news
